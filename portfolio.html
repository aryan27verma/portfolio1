             <br>       
            The coursework was tough, but I thrived, spending countless nights coding and debugging in the lab. During in my <b>second year</b>, I landed an internship at a tech startup, gaining invaluable real-world experience that solidified his career choice.
            <br>    
            <b>third year</b>, I had become proficient enough to help my peers with projects, reinforcing my own understanding in the process. For my capstone project, I developed an <b>AI-driven</b> application to assist students with disabilities in navigating the campus. The project was a huge success, earning recognition from professors and peers alike.
            <br>
            Graduation day was a proud moment for me. Reflecting on my journey, I knew the late nights and hard work had paid off. With a job offer from a leading tech company, I was ready to make a significant impact in the world of technology.
